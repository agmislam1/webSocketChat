# webSocketChat
This is a simple websocket base chat application.

Back End is developed in spring.
Front End is developed in html, css, javascript

1. We implemented a chat room where multiple users can join. A user can join by entering a username. 
2. A user can see the list of users in the chat room along with their status(online/offline).
3. Users have a 'Do not disturb' option. If it's enabled, the user will not get any message and other users will know the person is offline.
